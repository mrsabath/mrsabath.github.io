### Hi there!

I am a Senior Technical Staff Member in [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) with over 27 years of experience in software engineering, specializing in distributed systems, cloud-native platforms, and open-source technologies. My focus is on establishing universal workload identity for secure multi-cloud and hybrid deployments, with a strong commitment to Zero Trust principles.

As a Senior Certified Level 3 (Thought Leader) Cloud Software Engineer, I design and develop large-scale, distributed cloud environments, primarily based on Kubernetes, Go, and Python, with a specialization in workload identity, secret management, and trusted identity frameworks to reduce attack surfaces and strengthen privacy and security across environments.

I currently lead architectural efforts aimed at improving security for AI Agentic Platforms ([Kagenti](http://kagenti.io)) project), combining workload attestation, token-based delegation, and centralized trust management to enable safe and autonomous AI operations.

Beyond my engineering work, I’m deeply engaged in the open-source community:

* Member of the [SPIFFE Steering Committee](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/ssc/README.md)
* Active maintainer and contributor to several CNCF and open-source projects
* Advocate for open collaboration and secure, scalable design

I co-authored several technical papers and filed over [20 patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Mariusz+Sabath).
