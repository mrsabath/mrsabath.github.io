### Hi there!

My name is Mariusz, and I am a senior software engineer
in [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) since 1997.
My research interests are system management and distributed,
scalable environments in Hybrid Cloud.
My current focus is security, identity, and secret management in Kubernetes environments.

I co-authored several technical papers and filed over [20 patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Mariusz+Sabath).
